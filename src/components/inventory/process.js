          look up old RFPOs and get contact info to order something again.  You
          can get supplier info this way.  If you are feeling lazy, just copy
          all the ordering lines and let the purchaser quote it out.  If we will
          be ordering a lot, it might be good to get it into inventory to be
          able to RFI tha' sucka'</p>
